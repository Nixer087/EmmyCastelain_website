I bring 15 years of experience in 3D animation, starting my journey as a modeller and shading artist before expanding my skills in lighting and rigging. Today, I am a proficient Python developer specializing in the animation industry. My work spans animated series, feature films, and VFX for movies and television, with expertise in tools like Maya for animation and Houdini for lighting.Based in Brussels, I have a passion for scripting in Unity for VR projects and enjoy exploring 3D software to craft compelling and innovative content. My dedication to both the technical and creative aspects of animation continues to drive my career forward.
